Hotel-Booking-Analysis
A data-driven analysis of hotel bookings to uncover patterns in customer behavior, cancellations, and seasonal trends.
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, process, and visualize booking data. The insights can help hotels improve revenue management, cancellation policies, and customer satisfaction strategies.
